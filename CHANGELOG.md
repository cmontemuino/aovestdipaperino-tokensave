# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [4.0.1-beta.1] - 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Multi-branch indexing** — opt-in per-branch databases so switching branches never gives stale results. `tokensave branch add` tracks a branch by copying the nearest ancestor DB and syncing only changed files. `tokensave branch list`, `tokensave branch remove`, and `tokensave branch gc` manage tracked branches.
- **`tokensave_branch_search`** — search symbols in another branch's code graph without switching your checkout.
- **`tokensave_branch_diff`** — compare code graphs between two branches: shows symbols added, removed, and changed (signature differs). Supports file and kind filters.
- **Branch fallback warnings** — when the MCP server serves from an ancestor branch DB (current branch not tracked), every tool response is prepended with a warning suggesting `tokensave branch add`.
- **Branch info in `tokensave_status`** — status output now includes `active_branch`, `branch_fallback`, and `branch_warning` fields when multi-branch is active.

### Changed
- Tool count increased from 34 to 36.

## [3.3.2] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- **Windows build failure blocking Homebrew/Scoop updates** — `SHELLEXECUTEINFOW` in `windows-sys` 0.59 requires the `Win32_System_Registry` feature flag, which was missing. This caused Windows CI builds to fail since v3.2.0, and because the release workflow used `fail-fast: true`, the failure cascaded to skip the Homebrew tap and Scoop bucket update jobs entirely. Users on Homebrew were stuck on v3.1.0. ([#12](https://github.com/aovestdipaperino/tokensave/issues/12))
- **`HANDLE` type mismatch on Windows** — `windows-sys` 0.59 changed `HANDLE` from `usize` to `*mut c_void`. The UAC elevation code now uses `std::ptr::null_mut()` and `.is_null()` instead of literal `0`.
- **Release workflow resilience** — changed build matrix to `fail-fast: false` and downstream jobs (`update-homebrew`, `update-scoop`) to `if: !cancelled()`, so a single platform build failure no longer blocks formula/manifest updates for platforms that succeeded.

## [3.3.1] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- **Windows `is_installed()` always returned `false`** — the daemon autostart check via `daemon-kit` used a file-path probe that returns `None` on Windows, so `is_service_installed()` never detected an existing service. This caused `tokensave install` to re-offer autostart every time. Now dispatches to the Windows SCM query that was already implemented but never wired up. (daemon-kit 0.1.4)
- **Windows `--enable-autostart` failed on reinstall** — running `tokensave daemon --enable-autostart` twice would error with "service already exists". The installer now stops and removes the old service before re-creating, making the operation idempotent. (daemon-kit 0.1.4)

### Added
- **Upgrade-aware daemon restart** — the background daemon now snapshots its own binary's mtime and size at startup and checks every 60 seconds. When an upgrade is detected (via `brew upgrade`, `cargo install`, `scoop update`, or any package manager), the daemon flushes pending syncs, logs the event, and exits. The service manager (launchd `KeepAlive`, systemd `Restart=on-failure`, Windows SCM failure actions) automatically relaunches with the new binary. Previously the old version ran until the next reboot or manual restart.
- **Windows SCM failure recovery** — the Windows service is now configured with `ServiceFailureActions` (restart after 5s, then 10s) so the SCM relaunches the daemon after upgrade-triggered exits.
- **Daemon version logging** — the daemon startup log now includes the version (`v3.3.1 started, watching N projects`) so log readers can confirm which version is running after an upgrade restart.

### Changed
- Bumped `daemon-kit` dependency from 0.1.3 to 0.1.4.

## [3.3.0] - 2026-04-05

### Changed
- **Sync progress now matches full-index display** — `tokensave sync` now shows `[current/total] syncing file (ETA: Ns)` with the braille spinner and path truncation, matching the progress display used during initial indexing. Previously sync only showed phase names without file counters or ETA.

### Added
- **MCP tool annotations** — all 34 tools now include `readOnlyHint: true` and a human-friendly `title` in their MCP annotations. Clients that support annotations can run all tokensave tools concurrently without permission prompts and display cleaner tool names.
- **`_meta["anthropic/alwaysLoad"]`** on core tools — `tokensave_context`, `tokensave_search`, and `tokensave_status` are marked for immediate loading, bypassing the client's tool-search round-trip on first use.
- **Server instructions** — the MCP `initialize` response now includes an `instructions` field guiding the model to start with `tokensave_context` and noting all tools are read-only and safe to call in parallel.
- **MCP resources** — three resources exposed via `resources/list` and `resources/read`:
  - `tokensave://status` — graph statistics as JSON
  - `tokensave://files` — indexed file tree grouped by directory
  - `tokensave://overview` — project summary with language distribution and symbol kinds
- **`tokensave_commit_context`** — semantic summary of uncommitted changes for commit message drafting. Returns changed symbols grouped by file role (source/test/config/docs), a suggested commit category, and recent commit subjects for style matching.
- **`tokensave_pr_context`** — semantic diff between two git refs for pull request descriptions. Returns commit log, symbols added/modified, affected tests, and impacted modules.
- **`tokensave_simplify_scan`** — quality analysis of changed files: detects symbol duplications, dead code introductions, complexity hotspots, and high-coupling files.
- **`tokensave_test_map`** — source-to-test mapping at the symbol level. Shows which test functions call which source functions and identifies uncovered symbols.
- **`tokensave_type_hierarchy`** — recursive type hierarchy tree for traits, interfaces, and classes showing all implementors and extenders with file locations.
- **`tokensave_context` extended** — new `include_code` parameter includes source code snippets for key symbols (wires through to the existing context builder). New `mode: "plan"` parameter appends extension points (public traits/interfaces with implementor counts) and test coverage for related modules.

### Changed
- Tool count increased from 29 to 34.
- Trimmed verbose tool descriptions for lower token overhead in deferred tool lists (`tokensave_rank`, `tokensave_coupling`, `tokensave_port_status`, `tokensave_port_order`, `tokensave_affected`, `tokensave_complexity`, `tokensave_doc_coverage`, `tokensave_god_class`, `tokensave_recursion`, `tokensave_inheritance_depth`, `tokensave_distribution`).

## [3.2.2] - 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- **MCP tools no longer warn on patch-only updates** — the `tokensave_status` MCP tool now uses `is_newer_minor_version` instead of `is_newer_version`, so patch-level releases (e.g. 3.2.0 → 3.2.1) no longer trigger update warnings in MCP tool output. The CLI status command continues to show all available updates.
- **Separate beta/stable update channels** — `is_newer_version` now returns `false` for cross-channel comparisons (beta vs stable). Previously a beta user could be told to upgrade to a stable release, or vice versa. Each channel now only sees updates from its own channel.

## [3.1.1] - 2026-04-02

### Fixed
- **Windows daemon service installation** — `tokensave install` and `tokensave daemon --enable-autostart` no longer fail on non-elevated Windows terminals. When administrator privileges are required to register the Windows Service, the process now automatically requests UAC elevation for just the service installation step; everything else continues non-elevated. ([#7](https://github.com/aovestdipaperino/tokensave/issues/7))
- **Quieter version update warnings** — the CLI no longer warns about patch-only releases (e.g. 3.2.0 → 3.2.1); warnings now appear only for minor or major version bumps. The status page (`tokensave_status` MCP tool) continues to show all available updates.

## [3.1.0] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- **Edge duplication during incremental sync** — reference resolution was re-resolving ALL unresolved refs on every sync (not just from changed files) and inserting duplicate edges with no deduplication. Over many syncs this caused unbounded DB growth (e.g. 5.1 GB for a 108 MB codebase). A unique index on edges and `INSERT OR IGNORE` now prevent duplicates entirely. A V5 migration automatically deduplicates existing databases on upgrade. ([#5](https://github.com/aovestdipaperino/tokensave/issues/5))

### Added
- **Concurrent sync prevention** — a PID-based lockfile (`.tokensave/sync.lock`) prevents the CLI and the background daemon from running sync simultaneously. If a sync is already in progress, the second attempt fails immediately with a clear error message. Stale locks from crashed processes are reclaimed automatically.
- **`doctor` database compaction** — `tokensave doctor` now opens the project database, reports its size, and runs `VACUUM + ANALYZE` to reclaim space. Particularly useful after upgrading from versions affected by edge duplication.
- **Index design documentation** — new `docs/INDEX-DESIGN.md` describes the full indexing pipeline, database schema, extraction process, reference resolution, incremental sync, and how `diff_context` uses the graph.

## [3.0.1] - 2026-04-01

### Fixed
- **Safe JSON config editing** — `tokensave install` no longer silently destroys agent config files (e.g. `opencode.json`, `settings.json`) when they contain invalid or unparseable JSON. Previously, a parse failure caused the file to be silently replaced with an empty object plus the tokensave entry, wiping all existing configuration.

### Added
- **Atomic backup before config writes** — a `.bak` copy of the original file is created (via atomic staging) before any modification. If the install fails at any point, the original file is untouched and the backup is preserved.
- **Strict JSON/JSONC loading for edits** — new `load_json_file_strict` and `load_jsonc_file_strict` functions return an error (with a helpful hint) when an existing file cannot be parsed, instead of silently returning `{}`.
- **Atomic config writes** — new content is written to a `.new` sibling file first, then atomically renamed into place via `rename(2)`. The original file is never opened for writing, so a crash or interruption cannot leave it half-written.
- **20 regression tests** covering backup creation, strict loading, atomic writes, round-trip validation, and the end-to-end install cycle for both valid and corrupt config files.

## [3.0.0] - 2026-03-28

### Changed
- **Bundled tree-sitter grammars** — all 31 language grammars now come from the `tokensave-large-treesitters` crate (which includes `tokensave-medium-treesitters` and `tokensave-lite-treesitters`). Zero individual `tree-sitter-*` crate dependencies remain in tokensave itself. The grammar provider (`ts_provider`) is a single `LazyLock<HashMap>` lookup, replacing 100+ lines of per-crate match arms.
- **Removed vendored C grammars** — the Protobuf and COBOL grammars previously compiled from C source via `build.rs` are now vendored inside the bundled crate. tokensave no longer needs `cc` as a build dependency.
- **Simplified feature flags** — the `lang-*` feature flags still control which extractors are compiled, but no longer pull in individual grammar crate dependencies (all grammars are always present via the bundle). The `ts-ffi`/`ts-rust`/`ts-both` grammar source selection flags have been removed.

### Added
- **Daemon install prompt** — `tokensave install` now offers to install the background daemon as an autostart service (launchd on macOS, systemd on Linux) after agent configuration. Skips silently in non-interactive mode or when the service is already installed.
- **Last sync / Full sync in status** — the status table header now shows a third row with relative timestamps for the most recent incremental sync and the most recent full reindex, stored in the metadata table.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **Daemon mode** — `tokensave daemon` watches all tracked projects for file changes and runs incremental syncs automatically; debounce configurable via `daemon_debounce` in `~/.tokensave/config.toml` (default `"15s"`)
- **Daemon management** — `--stop`, `--status`, `--foreground` flags for process control; PID file at `~/.tokensave/daemon.pid`
- **Autostart service** — `--enable-autostart` / `--disable-autostart` generates and manages a launchd plist (macOS) or systemd user unit (Linux); cross-platform via `daemon-kit` crate
- **Doctor daemon checks** — `tokensave doctor` now reports daemon running status and autostart configuration
- **`daemon-kit` crate** — new standalone cross-platform daemon/service toolkit published to crates.io, using `daemonize2` on Unix and `windows-service` on Windows

## [2.3.2] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **5 new agent integrations** — Copilot (VS Code), Cursor, Zed, Cline, and Roo Code now supported via `tokensave install --agent <id>`; each registers the MCP server in the agent's native config format (VS Code `settings.json`, `~/.cursor/mcp.json`, Zed `settings.json`, Cline/Roo Code `cline_mcp_settings.json`)
- **Auto-detect agents** — running `tokensave install` without `--agent` detects which agents are installed by checking their config directories; if one is found it installs directly, if multiple are found an interactive checkbox selector is shown
- **Installed-agent tracking** — `installed_agents` list in `~/.tokensave/config.toml` tracks which integrations are active; on upgrade from older versions the list is backfilled by scanning existing configs
- **Uninstall-all** — `tokensave uninstall` without `--agent` silently removes all tracked integrations
- **JSONC parser** — VS Code and Zed settings files (JSON with comments and trailing commas) are now parsed correctly

### Changed
- **Renamed `Agent` trait to `AgentIntegration`** and all struct names from `XxxAgent` to `XxxIntegration` for consistency; functions renamed accordingly (`get_integration`, `all_integrations`, etc.)

## [2.3.1] - 2026-03-27

### Changed
- **Version-update warning suppressed for 15 minutes** — the "Update available" notice shown after `sync` and in MCP tool responses is now suppressed for 15 minutes after it was last displayed, reducing noise for frequent users; `tokensave status` always shows the warning regardless of suppression

## [2.3.0] - 2026-03-27

### Added
- **`--skip-folder` flag for sync** — accepts one or more folder names to exclude during indexing (e.g. `tokensave sync --skip-folder tests benches`); each folder is converted to a `folder/**` glob pattern at runtime
- **ETA during full index** — the progress spinner now shows `[current/total]` file counts and an estimated time remaining (e.g. `[12/150] indexing src/main.rs (ETA: 8s)`)

### Changed
- `index_all_with_progress` callback signature now provides `(current, total, path)` for richer progress reporting
- Schema migration re-index also shows `[current/total]` progress

## [2.2.0] - 2026-03-27

### Changed
- **Status table title split into two rows** — top row shows version (left) and country flags (right); bottom row shows token counts right-aligned in green
- **Country flags always shown** — removed `--show-flags` option; flags are now fetched automatically and cached for 30 minutes
- **Fixed table width** — cell width capped at 32 columns (max table width 100), with a derived maximum of 25 display flags
- **Upgraded gix to v0.81.0** — from v0.72.1; added explicit `sha1` feature flag and adapted to new `ControlFlow`-based tree diff API

## [2.1.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **QuickBASIC 4.5 language support** — new `QuickBasicExtractor` handles `.bi` (include) and `.bm` (module) files, sharing the QBasic grammar under the existing `lang-qbasic` feature flag (31 languages total)
- **`gix` for native git operations** — replaced `Command::new("git")` shell-outs with the `gix` crate (minimal features: `revision` + `blob-diff`), removing the runtime dependency on a `git` binary for commit counting and tree diffing
- **Test coverage improvements** — 77 new tests across 6 files:
  - `complexity_test.rs` (18 tests) — direct tests for the complexity counting algorithm: branches, loops, nesting, unsafe blocks, unwrap/expect detection, assertion counting
  - `rust_extraction_test.rs` (17 tests) — Rust extractor: functions, structs, enums, traits, impls, modules, async, visibility, derive macros, call sites
  - `display_test.rs` (10 tests) — formatting functions with boundary values
  - `php_extraction_test.rs` (11 tests) — classes, interfaces, traits, namespaces, enums, visibility, inheritance
  - `ruby_extraction_test.rs` (9 tests) — classes, modules, methods, inheritance, constants, nested classes
  - `quickbasic_extraction_test.rs` (12 tests) — QB4.5-specific parsing (REDIM, SLEEP, ERASE), SUBs, FUNCTIONs, TYPEs, call sites

### Changed
- **Legacy BASIC grammars updated to 0.2.0** — `tree-sitter-qbasic`, `tree-sitter-msbasic2`, and `tree-sitter-gwbasic` bumped from 0.1 to 0.2, adding 27 new AST node types for QuickBasic 4.5 constructs (REDIM, SLEEP, ERASE, SHELL, metacommands, and more)
- `git_commits_since` now uses `gix` revision walk with `ByCommitTimeCutoff` sorting, which is more efficient than the previous `git log` approach as gix stops walking once all queued commits are older than the cutoff
- `handle_changelog` tree diff now uses `gix` tree-to-tree comparison with rename tracking, replacing `git diff --name-only`

## [2.0.3] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- **Windows: sync re-adding files** — normalize all relative file paths to forward slashes in the scanner, preventing path mismatch between index and sync on Windows
- **Windows: wrong upgrade command** — detect Scoop installations (`\scoop\` in binary path) and suggest `scoop update tokensave` instead of `cargo install tokensave`
- **Windows: git hook backslashes** — write forward slashes in `core.hooksPath` and the post-commit hook snippet, since Git's shell expects `/` separators
- **Scoop bucket structure** — moved manifest to `bucket/` subdirectory for better compatibility with `scoop update`
- **Double-counted token savings** — "Global" total no longer includes the current project's count; display now shows "Project" and "All projects" labels

## [2.0.2] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- COBOL tree-sitter scanner uses fixed-size arrays instead of C99 variable-length arrays, fixing MSVC compilation failure on Windows that blocked the v2.0.0 Scoop manifest update

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added

#### 16 new language extractors (15 → 30 languages)
- **Swift** — classes, structs, protocols, enums, extensions, init constructors, async methods, visibility modifiers, inheritance
- **Bash** — functions, `readonly` constants, `source` imports, command call sites, comment docstrings
- **Lua** — functions, colon-methods (OOP via metatables), `require()` imports, LDoc comments, `local` constants
- **Zig** — structs, enums, unions, pub/private visibility, `@import` resolution, `test` blocks as functions, doc comments
- **Protobuf** — `message` → `ProtoMessage`, `service` → `ProtoService`, `rpc` → `ProtoRpc` (new node kinds), enums, fields with type signatures, nested messages, `oneof`, package, imports
- **Nix** — functions, modules (attrsets), constants, `inherit` as imports, `apply_expression` call sites, `#` comments
- **VB.NET** — classes, structures, interfaces, modules, enums, `Sub`/`Function`, `Sub New` constructors, properties, `Inherits`/`Implements`, XML doc comments
- **PowerShell** — functions, typed constants, `Import-Module` / dot-source imports, command call sites, `<# ... #>` block comments
- **Batch/CMD** — labels as functions, `SET` as constants, `CALL :label` as call sites, `REM` docstrings (no complexity counting — too flat)
- **Perl** — `sub` functions/methods, `package` as modules, `use`/`require` imports, `our` constants, method invocations (`->`), `#` comments
- **Objective-C** — `@interface`/`@implementation`/`@protocol`, instance (`-`) and class (`+`) methods, `@property`, `NS_ENUM`, `#import`, message expression call sites, inheritance and protocol conformance
- **Fortran** — `module`, `program`, `subroutine`, `function`, derived `type` with fields, `type extends()` inheritance, `interface`, `parameter` constants, `use` imports, `!` comments
- **COBOL** — `PROGRAM-ID` as module, paragraph labels as functions, `WORKING-STORAGE` data items as fields/constants, `PERFORM` as call sites, `REM` comments (vendored grammar)
- **MS BASIC 2.0** — subroutine synthesis from `REM...RETURN` blocks, `LET` constants, `GOSUB`/`GOTO` call sites
- **GW-BASIC** — `DEF FN` functions, `WHILE/WEND` loops, subroutine synthesis, typed constants
- **QBasic** — `SUB`/`FUNCTION` blocks, `TYPE...END TYPE` as structs with fields, `CONST`, `DIM SHARED`, `CALL` sites, `SELECT CASE`

#### Enhanced Nix extraction
- **Derivation field extraction** — `mkDerivation`, `mkShell`, `buildPythonPackage`, `buildGoModule`, `buildRustPackage`, `buildNpmPackage` calls have their attrset arguments extracted as `Field` nodes (`pname`, `version`, `buildInputs`, `nativeBuildInputs`, `src`, `meta`, etc.)
- **Import path resolution** — `import ./path.nix` creates a `Use` node with a `Uses` unresolved ref, enabling cross-file dependency tracking via `tokensave_callers` and `tokensave_impact`
- **Flake output schema awareness** — in `flake.nix` files, standard output attributes (`packages`, `devShells`, `apps`, `nixosModules`, `nixosConfigurations`, `overlays`, `lib`, `checks`, `formatter`) are force-classified as `Module` nodes with recursive child extraction

#### Feature flag tiers
- Three compilation tiers via Cargo feature flags to control binary size:
  - **`lite`** (11 languages, always compiled): Rust, Go, Java, Scala, TypeScript/JS, Python, C, C++, Kotlin, C#, Swift
  - **`medium`** (20 languages): lite + Dart, Pascal, PHP, Ruby, Bash, Protobuf, PowerShell, Nix, VB.NET
  - **`full`** (30 languages, default): medium + Lua, Zig, Objective-C, Perl, Batch/CMD, Fortran, COBOL, MS BASIC 2.0, GW-BASIC, QBasic
- Individual `lang-*` feature flags for cherry-picking languages (e.g., `--no-default-features --features lang-nix,lang-bash`)
- `default = ["full"]` — existing users get all 30 languages with no config changes

#### New node kinds
- `ProtoMessage` — Protobuf message definitions
- `ProtoService` — Protobuf service definitions
- `ProtoRpc` — Protobuf RPC method definitions

#### Porting assessment tools
- **`tokensave_port_status`** — compare symbols between source and target directories within the same project to track porting progress; matches by name with cross-language kind compatibility (`class` ↔ `struct`, `interface` ↔ `trait`); reports matched/unmatched/target-only counts and coverage percentage
- **`tokensave_port_order`** — topological sort of source symbols for porting; uses Kahn's algorithm on the internal dependency graph to produce levels (port leaves first, then dependents); detects and reports dependency cycles

#### Agent prompt improvements
- **SQLite fallback instruction** — agents are told to query `.tokensave/tokensave.db` directly via SQL when MCP tools can't answer a code analysis question
- **Improvement feedback loop** — agents propose opening a GitHub issue when they discover an extractor/schema/tool gap, reminding the user to strip sensitive data

### Changed
- Cargo.toml `description` now lists lite-tier languages with "and many more" instead of all 30
- Vendored tree-sitter grammars for Protobuf and COBOL (no compatible crates for tree-sitter 0.26)

### Breaking
- Tree-sitter grammar dependencies for medium/full tier languages are now **optional** behind feature flags. Downstream crates depending on specific extractors must enable the corresponding `lang-*` feature.
- `cargo install tokensave --no-default-features` now builds a **lite** binary (11 languages) instead of the previous 15. To get the old behavior, use `cargo install tokensave` (default = full, 30 languages).
- Three new `NodeKind` variants (`ProtoMessage`, `ProtoService`, `ProtoRpc`) added — code matching exhaustively on `NodeKind` will need updating.

### Upgrade guide
```bash
cargo install tokensave          # or: brew upgrade tokensave
tokensave install                # re-run to get updated prompt rules
tokensave sync --force           # re-index to pick up new language extractors
```

## [1.10.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **Version update notifications** — the MCP server checks GitHub releases (with a 5-minute cache) and warns users when a newer version is available, via both a `notifications/message` logging notification and a text block prepended to tool responses
- **Global git post-commit hook** — `tokensave install` now offers to install a global `post-commit` hook that auto-runs `tokensave sync` after each commit, keeping the index up to date without manual intervention
- MCP `logging` capability advertised in `initialize` response
- Minimal gitconfig parser for reading `core.hooksPath` from `~/.gitconfig` and `~/.config/git/config` without shelling out to `git`
- 12 unit tests for gitconfig parsing, insertion, and tilde expansion

## [1.8.3] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- OpenCode MCP config uses `mcp` key (not `mcpServers`) with `"type": "local"` and `"command": [bin, "serve"]` array format, matching the current OpenCode schema
- Removed legacy `~/.opencode.json` fallback — config always writes to `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`)
- Healthcheck validates the `command` array contains `"serve"` instead of checking `args`

## [1.8.2] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- OpenCode config path resolution now checks `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (modern location) before `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and `~/.opencode.json` (legacy)
- OpenCode prompt path prefers `~/.config/opencode/OPENCODE.md` when the modern config directory exists

## [1.8.1] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **OpenCode agent** (`tokensave install --agent opencode`) — registers MCP server in `.opencode.json`, appends prompt rules to `OPENCODE.md`; healthcheck validates config and prompt file
- **Codex CLI agent** (`tokensave install --agent codex`) — registers MCP server in `~/.codex/config.toml` with auto-approval for all 27 tools, appends prompt rules to `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`; healthcheck validates config, tool approval counts, and prompt file
- TOML helpers (`load_toml_file`, `write_toml_file`) in agents module for Codex config support
- `TOOL_NAMES` constant with bare tool names (without agent-specific prefix) for cross-agent use

### New files
- `src/agents/opencode.rs` — `OpenCodeAgent` implementing `Agent`
- `src/agents/codex.rs` — `CodexAgent` implementing `Agent`

## [1.8.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **Multi-agent architecture** with a trait-based `Agent` abstraction (`install`, `uninstall`, `healthcheck`) to support CLI agents beyond Claude Code
- `tokensave install [--agent NAME]` replaces `claude-install` — defaults to `claude` when no agent is specified
- `tokensave uninstall [--agent NAME]` replaces `claude-uninstall` — defaults to `claude`
- `tokensave doctor [--agent NAME]` now checks all registered agents by default; use `--agent` to narrow to one
- Agent registry with `get_agent()`, `all_agents()`, and `available_agents()` for programmatic access
- `tokensave install --agent unknown` returns a clear error listing available agents

### Changed
- Extracted ~600 lines of Claude-specific install/uninstall/doctor logic from `main.rs` into `src/agents/claude.rs`
- Shared helpers (`load_json_file`, `write_json_file`, `which_tokensave`, `home_dir`, `DoctorCounters`, `EXPECTED_TOOL_PERMS`) moved to `src/agents/mod.rs`
- Error messages updated from `tokensave claude-install` to `tokensave install`
- Backward compatibility preserved: `tokensave claude-install` and `tokensave claude-uninstall` still work as aliases

### New files
- `src/agents/mod.rs` — `Agent` trait, `InstallContext`, `HealthcheckContext`, `DoctorCounters`, agent registry, shared helpers
- `src/agents/claude.rs` — `ClaudeAgent` implementing `Agent`

## [1.7.1] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- Database schema migrations now trigger an automatic full re-index instead of printing a warning asking users to run `tokensave sync --full` manually

### Changed
- Decomposed 6 oversized functions into small orchestrators + helpers for NASA Power of 10 Rule 4 compliance (no function exceeds 47 lines):
  - `run_doctor` (389 → 31 lines + 14 helpers)
  - `claude_install` (265 → 35 lines + 8 helpers)
  - `claude_uninstall` (160 → 16 lines + 6 helpers)
  - `print_status_table` (179 → 22 lines + 6 helpers)
  - `extract_symbols_from_query` (147 → 13 lines + helper)
  - `get_tool_definitions` (445 → 30 lines + 27 per-tool `def_*()` helpers)
- Added 84 `debug_assert!` preconditions and postconditions across 10 source files for NASA Power of 10 Rule 5 compliance (zero overhead in release builds)

## [1.7.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **3 new safety metrics on every function/method node** extracted from the AST during indexing, enabling NASA Power of 10 compliance audits without grep:
  - `unsafe_blocks` — counts unsafe blocks/statements (Rust `unsafe {}`, C# `unsafe {}`)
  - `unchecked_calls` — counts force-unwrap and unchecked operations (Rust `.unwrap()`/`.expect()`, TypeScript `!`, Kotlin `!!`, Java `.get()` on Optional, Scala `.get()`, Ruby `.fetch()`)
  - `assertions` — counts assertion calls per function (Rust `assert!`/`debug_assert!`, Java `assertEquals`, Python `assertEqual`, Go `require`, C++ `EXPECT_EQ`/`ASSERT_TRUE`, and framework-specific variants for all 15 languages)
- Extended `ComplexityConfig` with 6 new fields (`unsafe_types`, `unchecked_types`, `unchecked_methods`, `call_expression_types`, `call_method_field`, `assertion_names`, `macro_invocation_types`) to support cross-language detection
- `count_complexity` now accepts source bytes for method-name and macro-name matching in call expressions
- DB migration V4 adds `unsafe_blocks`, `unchecked_calls`, and `assertions` columns to the nodes table
- `tokensave_node` and `tokensave_complexity` MCP tools now include the 3 new fields in their responses
- Migration log message advises users to run `tokensave sync --full` to populate new columns for existing data

## [1.6.2] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- Suppressed the "new tokensave tool(s) not yet permitted" warning when running `tokensave claude-install`, since that command is about to fix the permissions anyway

## [1.6.1] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- `claude-install` now registers all 27 tool permissions — 9 tools added in v1.6.0 (`complexity`, `coupling`, `distribution`, `doc_coverage`, `god_class`, `inheritance_depth`, `largest`, `rank`, `recursion`) were missing from `EXPECTED_TOOL_PERMS`, so `claude-install` didn't grant them and `doctor` didn't flag them
- README permissions example updated to show all 27 tools (was showing only 9)
- README: fixed MCP server location reference (`~/.claude.json`, not `~/.claude/settings.json`)

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- 9 new MCP tools (27 total) for codebase analytics, code quality, and guideline compliance:
  - `tokensave_rank` — rank nodes by relationship count with direction support (incoming/outgoing); answers "most implemented interface", "class that implements the most interfaces", etc.
  - `tokensave_largest` — rank nodes by line count; find largest classes, longest methods
  - `tokensave_coupling` — rank files by fan-in (most depended-on) or fan-out (most dependencies)
  - `tokensave_inheritance_depth` — find deepest class hierarchies via recursive CTE on extends chains
  - `tokensave_distribution` — node kind breakdown per file/directory with summary mode
  - `tokensave_recursion` — detect recursive/mutually-recursive call cycles (NASA Power of 10, Rule 1)
  - `tokensave_complexity` — rank functions by composite complexity score with real cyclomatic complexity from AST
  - `tokensave_doc_coverage` — find public symbols missing documentation (Rust guidelines M-CANONICAL-DOCS)
  - `tokensave_god_class` — find classes with the most members (methods + fields)
- **Complexity metrics on every function/method node** — 4 new columns extracted from the AST during indexing:
  - `branches` — branching statements (if, match/switch arms, ternary, catch). CC = branches + 1.
  - `loops` — loop constructs (for, while, loop, do). Enables NASA Rule 2 audits.
  - `returns` — early exits (return, break, continue, throw).
  - `max_nesting` — deepest brace nesting level. Enables NASA Rule 1 (≤4 levels) audits.
- Generic `count_complexity()` helper with per-language configs for all 15 supported languages
- DB migration V3 adds the 4 complexity columns to the nodes table
- All new tools use efficient SQL queries (JOINs, GROUP BY, recursive CTEs) instead of loading all edges into memory

## [1.5.4] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- Token counter inflation: `tokensave_files` no longer accumulates tokens saved (listing file names is metadata, not a file-read substitute)
- Worldwide counter staleness: periodic flush every 30 seconds during MCP sessions instead of only on shutdown
- Shutdown flush was effectively a no-op (delta always 0 because `accumulate_tokens_saved` already upserted the current value to global DB); now uses `last_flushed_tokens` to correctly track remaining delta

## [1.5.1] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- `tokensave doctor` command — comprehensive health check of binary, project index, global DB, user config, Claude Code integration (MCP server, hook, permissions, CLAUDE.md), and network connectivity
- Stale install warning: automatically detects when `claude-install` needs re-running due to new tool permissions and warns on every CLI command

### Added
- 9 new MCP tools (18 total):
  - `tokensave_dead_code` — find unreachable symbols with no incoming edges
  - `tokensave_diff_context` — semantic context for changed files (modified symbols, dependencies, affected tests)
  - `tokensave_module_api` — public API surface of a file or directory
  - `tokensave_circular` — detect circular file dependencies
  - `tokensave_hotspots` — most connected symbols by edge count
  - `tokensave_similar` — find symbols with similar names
  - `tokensave_rename_preview` — all references to a symbol
  - `tokensave_unused_imports` — import statements never referenced
  - `tokensave_changelog` — semantic diff between two git refs
- `get_all_edges()`, `get_nodes_by_file()`, `get_all_nodes()`, `get_incoming_edges()`, `get_outgoing_edges()` delegation methods on `TokenSave`
- `find_circular_dependencies()` graph query for file-level cycle detection
- `tokensave status` prompts to create index if none exists (Y/n)
- Country flags in status output via `--show-flags`

## [1.4.3] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- Country flags row in `tokensave status` — shows emoji flags of countries where tokensave is used, centered below the token counters
- `fetch_country_flags()` in cloud module (500ms timeout, best-effort)
- Flags truncated with ellipsis if they exceed the available table width

## [1.4.2] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- PHP language support (`.php`) — functions, classes, methods, traits, interfaces, enums, constants, properties, namespaces, imports, and call sites
- Ruby language support (`.rb`) — methods, classes, modules, constants, inheritance, and call sites

## [1.4.1] - 2026-03-25

### Added

- Scoop package manager support for Windows (`scoop install tokensave`)
- Automated Scoop bucket updates on release
- Automated Homebrew formula + bottle updates on release

### Changed
- README updated with all install methods (brew, scoop, cargo, prebuilt binaries)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- Worldwide token-saved counter — aggregates anonymous token counts across all tokensave users via Cloudflare Worker + Upstash Redis
- `tokensave status` shows three tiers: Local, Global, and Worldwide token counts
- `tokensave disable-upload-counter` / `tokensave enable-upload-counter` commands to opt out of uploading
- All upload state stored transparently in `~/.tokensave/config.toml`
- Version check on `status` (5-min cache) and `sync` (parallel, no added latency) with auto-detected upgrade command (cargo/brew)
- First-run notice informing users about the worldwide counter and how to opt out
- Flush cooldown (60s) after failed uploads to prevent sluggish CLI during outages
- Network Calls & Privacy section in README documenting all outbound requests

### Changed
- `update_global_db()` now computes token-saved deltas for accurate pending upload accumulation
- Moved Cloudflare Worker source to separate `tokensave-cloud` repository

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- User-level global database (`~/.tokensave/global.db`) that tracks all TokenSave projects and their cumulative saved tokens
- `tokensave_status` and CLI `tokensave status` now report both local (project) and global (all projects) tokens saved when the global DB is available
- All CLI entry points (`sync`, `status`, `claude-install` init) register the project in the global DB on every run
- MCP server updates the global DB on every token accumulation and on shutdown (best-effort, no locking)

### Changed
- `print_status_table` title row shows `Local ~X  Global ~Y` when global data is available, falls back to `Tokens saved ~X` otherwise

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- Renamed all remaining `codegraph` references in release workflow, Homebrew formula, setup script, and hook to `tokensave`
- Release workflow now produces `tokensave` binary, bottles, and source tarballs (was still using `codegraph` names)
- Homebrew formula class renamed from `Codegraph` to `Tokensave` with updated URLs
- Setup script variable `CODEGRAPH_BIN` renamed to `TOKENSAVE_BIN`
- CLAUDE.md marker in setup script updated to use `Tokensave` name

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- `claude-install` CLI command — configures Claude Code integration (MCP server, permissions, hook, CLAUDE.md rules) in a single step, replacing the bash `setup.sh` script
- `hook-pre-tool-use` hidden CLI command — cross-platform PreToolUse hook handler written in pure Rust (no bash/jq dependency), blocks Explore agents and exploration-style prompts

### Removed
- Embedded bash hook script — the hook is now a native Rust subcommand

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- `tokensave files` CLI command — list indexed files with `--filter` (directory prefix), `--pattern` (glob), and `--json` output
- `tokensave affected` CLI command — BFS through file dependency graph to find test files impacted by source changes; supports `--stdin` (pipe from `git diff --name-only`), `--depth`, `--filter`, `--json`, `--quiet`
- `tokensave_files` MCP tool — file listing with path/pattern filtering, flat or grouped-by-directory output
- `tokensave_affected` MCP tool — find affected test files via file-level dependency traversal
