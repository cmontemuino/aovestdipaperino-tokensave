# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [2.0.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **30 language support** — added 16 new language extractors: Swift, Bash, Lua, Zig, Protobuf, Nix, VB.NET, PowerShell, Batch/CMD, Perl, Objective-C, Fortran, COBOL, MS BASIC 2.0, GW-BASIC, QBasic
- **Nix deep extraction** — derivation field extraction (`pname`, `buildInputs`, etc.), `import ./path` file dependency resolution, and flake.nix output schema awareness (`packages`, `devShells`, `apps`, etc.)
- **Feature flag tiers** for controlling binary size:
  - `lite` (11 languages, always compiled): Rust, Go, Java, Scala, TypeScript/JS, Python, C, C++, Kotlin, C#, Swift
  - `medium` (20 languages): lite + Dart, Pascal, PHP, Ruby, Bash, Protobuf, PowerShell, Nix, VB.NET
  - `full` (30 languages, default): medium + Lua, Zig, Objective-C, Perl, Batch/CMD, Fortran, COBOL, MS BASIC 2.0, GW-BASIC, QBasic
- Individual `lang-*` feature flags for fine-grained control (e.g., `--features lang-nix,lang-bash`)
- `ProtoMessage`, `ProtoService`, `ProtoRpc` node kinds for Protobuf schema graph support

### Breaking
- Tree-sitter grammar dependencies for medium/full tier languages are now optional. Downstream crates depending on specific extractors must enable the corresponding `lang-*` feature.
- `cargo install tokensave --no-default-features` now builds a lite binary (11 languages) instead of all 15.

## [1.10.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **Version update notifications** — the MCP server checks GitHub releases (with a 5-minute cache) and warns users when a newer version is available, via both a `notifications/message` logging notification and a text block prepended to tool responses
- **Global git post-commit hook** — `tokensave install` now offers to install a global `post-commit` hook that auto-runs `tokensave sync` after each commit, keeping the index up to date without manual intervention
- MCP `logging` capability advertised in `initialize` response
- Minimal gitconfig parser for reading `core.hooksPath` from `~/.gitconfig` and `~/.config/git/config` without shelling out to `git`
- 12 unit tests for gitconfig parsing, insertion, and tilde expansion

## [1.8.3] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- OpenCode MCP config uses `mcp` key (not `mcpServers`) with `"type": "local"` and `"command": [bin, "serve"]` array format, matching the current OpenCode schema
- Removed legacy `~/.opencode.json` fallback — config always writes to `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME`)
- Healthcheck validates the `command` array contains `"serve"` instead of checking `args`

## [1.8.2] - 2026-03-26

### Fixed
- OpenCode config path resolution now checks `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` (modern location) before `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and `~/.opencode.json` (legacy)
- OpenCode prompt path prefers `~/.config/opencode/OPENCODE.md` when the modern config directory exists

## [1.8.1] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **OpenCode agent** (`tokensave install --agent opencode`) — registers MCP server in `.opencode.json`, appends prompt rules to `OPENCODE.md`; healthcheck validates config and prompt file
- **Codex CLI agent** (`tokensave install --agent codex`) — registers MCP server in `~/.codex/config.toml` with auto-approval for all 27 tools, appends prompt rules to `~/.codex/AGENTS.md`; healthcheck validates config, tool approval counts, and prompt file
- TOML helpers (`load_toml_file`, `write_toml_file`) in agents module for Codex config support
- `TOOL_NAMES` constant with bare tool names (without agent-specific prefix) for cross-agent use

### New files
- `src/agents/opencode.rs` — `OpenCodeAgent` implementing `Agent`
- `src/agents/codex.rs` — `CodexAgent` implementing `Agent`

## [1.8.0] - 2026-03-26

### Added
- **Multi-agent architecture** with a trait-based `Agent` abstraction (`install`, `uninstall`, `healthcheck`) to support CLI agents beyond Claude Code
- `tokensave install [--agent NAME]` replaces `claude-install` — defaults to `claude` when no agent is specified
- `tokensave uninstall [--agent NAME]` replaces `claude-uninstall` — defaults to `claude`
- `tokensave doctor [--agent NAME]` now checks all registered agents by default; use `--agent` to narrow to one
- Agent registry with `get_agent()`, `all_agents()`, and `available_agents()` for programmatic access
- `tokensave install --agent unknown` returns a clear error listing available agents

### Changed
- Extracted ~600 lines of Claude-specific install/uninstall/doctor logic from `main.rs` into `src/agents/claude.rs`
- Shared helpers (`load_json_file`, `write_json_file`, `which_tokensave`, `home_dir`, `DoctorCounters`, `EXPECTED_TOOL_PERMS`) moved to `src/agents/mod.rs`
- Error messages updated from `tokensave claude-install` to `tokensave install`
- Backward compatibility preserved: `tokensave claude-install` and `tokensave claude-uninstall` still work as aliases

### New files
- `src/agents/mod.rs` — `Agent` trait, `InstallContext`, `HealthcheckContext`, `DoctorCounters`, agent registry, shared helpers
- `src/agents/claude.rs` — `ClaudeAgent` implementing `Agent`

## [1.7.1] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- Database schema migrations now trigger an automatic full re-index instead of printing a warning asking users to run `tokensave sync --full` manually

### Changed
- Decomposed 6 oversized functions into small orchestrators + helpers for NASA Power of 10 Rule 4 compliance (no function exceeds 47 lines):
  - `run_doctor` (389 → 31 lines + 14 helpers)
  - `claude_install` (265 → 35 lines + 8 helpers)
  - `claude_uninstall` (160 → 16 lines + 6 helpers)
  - `print_status_table` (179 → 22 lines + 6 helpers)
  - `extract_symbols_from_query` (147 → 13 lines + helper)
  - `get_tool_definitions` (445 → 30 lines + 27 per-tool `def_*()` helpers)
- Added 84 `debug_assert!` preconditions and postconditions across 10 source files for NASA Power of 10 Rule 5 compliance (zero overhead in release builds)

## [1.7.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **3 new safety metrics on every function/method node** extracted from the AST during indexing, enabling NASA Power of 10 compliance audits without grep:
  - `unsafe_blocks` — counts unsafe blocks/statements (Rust `unsafe {}`, C# `unsafe {}`)
  - `unchecked_calls` — counts force-unwrap and unchecked operations (Rust `.unwrap()`/`.expect()`, TypeScript `!`, Kotlin `!!`, Java `.get()` on Optional, Scala `.get()`, Ruby `.fetch()`)
  - `assertions` — counts assertion calls per function (Rust `assert!`/`debug_assert!`, Java `assertEquals`, Python `assertEqual`, Go `require`, C++ `EXPECT_EQ`/`ASSERT_TRUE`, and framework-specific variants for all 15 languages)
- Extended `ComplexityConfig` with 6 new fields (`unsafe_types`, `unchecked_types`, `unchecked_methods`, `call_expression_types`, `call_method_field`, `assertion_names`, `macro_invocation_types`) to support cross-language detection
- `count_complexity` now accepts source bytes for method-name and macro-name matching in call expressions
- DB migration V4 adds `unsafe_blocks`, `unchecked_calls`, and `assertions` columns to the nodes table
- `tokensave_node` and `tokensave_complexity` MCP tools now include the 3 new fields in their responses
- Migration log message advises users to run `tokensave sync --full` to populate new columns for existing data

## [1.6.2] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- Suppressed the "new tokensave tool(s) not yet permitted" warning when running `tokensave claude-install`, since that command is about to fix the permissions anyway

## [1.6.1] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- `claude-install` now registers all 27 tool permissions — 9 tools added in v1.6.0 (`complexity`, `coupling`, `distribution`, `doc_coverage`, `god_class`, `inheritance_depth`, `largest`, `rank`, `recursion`) were missing from `EXPECTED_TOOL_PERMS`, so `claude-install` didn't grant them and `doctor` didn't flag them
- README permissions example updated to show all 27 tools (was showing only 9)
- README: fixed MCP server location reference (`~/.claude.json`, not `~/.claude/settings.json`)

## [1.6.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- 9 new MCP tools (27 total) for codebase analytics, code quality, and guideline compliance:
  - `tokensave_rank` — rank nodes by relationship count with direction support (incoming/outgoing); answers "most implemented interface", "class that implements the most interfaces", etc.
  - `tokensave_largest` — rank nodes by line count; find largest classes, longest methods
  - `tokensave_coupling` — rank files by fan-in (most depended-on) or fan-out (most dependencies)
  - `tokensave_inheritance_depth` — find deepest class hierarchies via recursive CTE on extends chains
  - `tokensave_distribution` — node kind breakdown per file/directory with summary mode
  - `tokensave_recursion` — detect recursive/mutually-recursive call cycles (NASA Power of 10, Rule 1)
  - `tokensave_complexity` — rank functions by composite complexity score with real cyclomatic complexity from AST
  - `tokensave_doc_coverage` — find public symbols missing documentation (Rust guidelines M-CANONICAL-DOCS)
  - `tokensave_god_class` — find classes with the most members (methods + fields)
- **Complexity metrics on every function/method node** — 4 new columns extracted from the AST during indexing:
  - `branches` — branching statements (if, match/switch arms, ternary, catch). CC = branches + 1.
  - `loops` — loop constructs (for, while, loop, do). Enables NASA Rule 2 audits.
  - `returns` — early exits (return, break, continue, throw).
  - `max_nesting` — deepest brace nesting level. Enables NASA Rule 1 (≤4 levels) audits.
- Generic `count_complexity()` helper with per-language configs for all 15 supported languages
- DB migration V3 adds the 4 complexity columns to the nodes table
- All new tools use efficient SQL queries (JOINs, GROUP BY, recursive CTEs) instead of loading all edges into memory

## [1.5.4] - 2026-03-25

### Fixed
- Token counter inflation: `tokensave_files` no longer accumulates tokens saved (listing file names is metadata, not a file-read substitute)
- Worldwide counter staleness: periodic flush every 30 seconds during MCP sessions instead of only on shutdown
- Shutdown flush was effectively a no-op (delta always 0 because `accumulate_tokens_saved` already upserted the current value to global DB); now uses `last_flushed_tokens` to correctly track remaining delta

## [1.5.1] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- `tokensave doctor` command — comprehensive health check of binary, project index, global DB, user config, Claude Code integration (MCP server, hook, permissions, CLAUDE.md), and network connectivity
- Stale install warning: automatically detects when `claude-install` needs re-running due to new tool permissions and warns on every CLI command

### Added
- 9 new MCP tools (18 total):
  - `tokensave_dead_code` — find unreachable symbols with no incoming edges
  - `tokensave_diff_context` — semantic context for changed files (modified symbols, dependencies, affected tests)
  - `tokensave_module_api` — public API surface of a file or directory
  - `tokensave_circular` — detect circular file dependencies
  - `tokensave_hotspots` — most connected symbols by edge count
  - `tokensave_similar` — find symbols with similar names
  - `tokensave_rename_preview` — all references to a symbol
  - `tokensave_unused_imports` — import statements never referenced
  - `tokensave_changelog` — semantic diff between two git refs
- `get_all_edges()`, `get_nodes_by_file()`, `get_all_nodes()`, `get_incoming_edges()`, `get_outgoing_edges()` delegation methods on `TokenSave`
- `find_circular_dependencies()` graph query for file-level cycle detection
- `tokensave status` prompts to create index if none exists (Y/n)
- Country flags in status output via `--show-flags`

## [1.4.3] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- Country flags row in `tokensave status` — shows emoji flags of countries where tokensave is used, centered below the token counters
- `fetch_country_flags()` in cloud module (500ms timeout, best-effort)
- Flags truncated with ellipsis if they exceed the available table width

## [1.4.2] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- PHP language support (`.php`) — functions, classes, methods, traits, interfaces, enums, constants, properties, namespaces, imports, and call sites
- Ruby language support (`.rb`) — methods, classes, modules, constants, inheritance, and call sites

## [1.4.1] - 2026-03-25

### Added

- Scoop package manager support for Windows (`scoop install tokensave`)
- Automated Scoop bucket updates on release
- Automated Homebrew formula + bottle updates on release

### Changed
- README updated with all install methods (brew, scoop, cargo, prebuilt binaries)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- Worldwide token-saved counter — aggregates anonymous token counts across all tokensave users via Cloudflare Worker + Upstash Redis
- `tokensave status` shows three tiers: Local, Global, and Worldwide token counts
- `tokensave disable-upload-counter` / `tokensave enable-upload-counter` commands to opt out of uploading
- All upload state stored transparently in `~/.tokensave/config.toml`
- Version check on `status` (5-min cache) and `sync` (parallel, no added latency) with auto-detected upgrade command (cargo/brew)
- First-run notice informing users about the worldwide counter and how to opt out
- Flush cooldown (60s) after failed uploads to prevent sluggish CLI during outages
- Network Calls & Privacy section in README documenting all outbound requests

### Changed
- `update_global_db()` now computes token-saved deltas for accurate pending upload accumulation
- Moved Cloudflare Worker source to separate `tokensave-cloud` repository

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- User-level global database (`~/.tokensave/global.db`) that tracks all TokenSave projects and their cumulative saved tokens
- `tokensave_status` and CLI `tokensave status` now report both local (project) and global (all projects) tokens saved when the global DB is available
- All CLI entry points (`sync`, `status`, `claude-install` init) register the project in the global DB on every run
- MCP server updates the global DB on every token accumulation and on shutdown (best-effort, no locking)

### Changed
- `print_status_table` title row shows `Local ~X  Global ~Y` when global data is available, falls back to `Tokens saved ~X` otherwise

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-24

### Fixed
- Renamed all remaining `codegraph` references in release workflow, Homebrew formula, setup script, and hook to `tokensave`
- Release workflow now produces `tokensave` binary, bottles, and source tarballs (was still using `codegraph` names)
- Homebrew formula class renamed from `Codegraph` to `Tokensave` with updated URLs
- Setup script variable `CODEGRAPH_BIN` renamed to `TOKENSAVE_BIN`
- CLAUDE.md marker in setup script updated to use `Tokensave` name

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- `claude-install` CLI command — configures Claude Code integration (MCP server, permissions, hook, CLAUDE.md rules) in a single step, replacing the bash `setup.sh` script
- `hook-pre-tool-use` hidden CLI command — cross-platform PreToolUse hook handler written in pure Rust (no bash/jq dependency), blocks Explore agents and exploration-style prompts

### Removed
- Embedded bash hook script — the hook is now a native Rust subcommand

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-24

### Added
- `tokensave files` CLI command — list indexed files with `--filter` (directory prefix), `--pattern` (glob), and `--json` output
- `tokensave affected` CLI command — BFS through file dependency graph to find test files impacted by source changes; supports `--stdin` (pipe from `git diff --name-only`), `--depth`, `--filter`, `--json`, `--quiet`
- `tokensave_files` MCP tool — file listing with path/pattern filtering, flat or grouped-by-directory output
- `tokensave_affected` MCP tool — find affected test files via file-level dependency traversal
