# MCP Tool Test Queries

Manual test queries for verifying all 36 tokensave MCP tools. Run these in a Claude Code session after `tokensave sync` and `tokensave install`.

### Staleness warnings

All tool responses may be prepended with staleness warnings when the index is out of date:

- **Per-file**: `WARNING: STALE INDEX — N file(s) modified since last sync: file1.rs, file2.rs. Run tokensave sync to update.`
- **Index age**: `WARNING: Index last synced Xh Ym ago. Run tokensave sync to update.`
- **Branch fallback**: `WARNING: branch 'feature-x' is not tracked — serving from 'main'. Run tokensave branch add feature-x to track it.`

To test staleness: edit a file without re-syncing, then call any tool that touches that file.
To test branch fallback: check out an untracked branch while multi-branch is active, then call any tool.

---

## tokensave_status

> What's the current status of the tokensave index?

Expected: Returns node/edge/file counts, DB size, language distribution, tokens saved. Also includes staleness info:
- `stale_commits`: number of git commits since last sync (if > 0)
- `stale_warning`: human-readable message about stale commits
- `stale_files`: count of files modified on disk since indexing (sampled up to 100)

When multi-branch is active, also includes:
- `active_branch`: the current git branch name
- `branch_fallback`: `true` if serving from an ancestor branch DB
- `branch_warning`: explanation of which branch DB is being used

To test staleness: make a git commit without running `tokensave sync`, then call status.

Test plan mode:
```

```
Expected: Standard context plus additional sections:
- **Extension Points**: public traits/interfaces with implementor counts
- **Test Coverage**: test files covering the related modules

> Are there any recursive or mutually-recursive call cycles? (NASA Power of 10, Rule 1)

Test:

---

## tokensave_port_status

> Compare porting progress between `src/python/` (source) and `src/rust/` (target).

Test:
```
tokensave_port_status(source_dir="src/python/", target_dir="src/rust/")
```
Expected: Returns coverage summary with matched/unmatched/target-only counts. Matches by name (case-insensitive) with cross-language kind compatibility (`class` matches `struct`, `interface` matches `trait`). Unmatched symbols are grouped by source file. Shows `coverage_percent`.

Custom kinds filter:
```
tokensave_port_status(source_dir="lib/old/", target_dir="lib/new/", kinds=["function", "method"])
```
Expected: Only compares functions and methods between the two directories.

---

## tokensave_port_order

Test:
```
tokensave_port_order(source_dir="src/python/", limit=30)
```
Expected: Returns symbols in topological dependency order, organized into levels:
- **Level 0**: No internal dependencies (utilities, constants) — port these first
- **Level 1**: Depends only on level 0 symbols
- **Level N**: Depends on levels 0 through N-1
- **Cycles**: Mutually dependent symbols flagged as "port together"

Each symbol shows its `depends_on` list (names of dependencies within the source dir).

Custom kinds:
```
tokensave_port_order(source_dir="src/legacy/", kinds=["function", "class"], limit=50)
```
Expected: Only includes functions and classes in the topological sort.

---

## tokensave_commit_context

> Summarize my uncommitted changes for a commit message.

Test all changes:
```
tokensave_commit_context()
```
Expected: Returns changed files with semantic roles (source/test/config/docs), symbols in each file, a suggested commit category (feature/fix/refactor/test/chore), and the 5 most recent commit subjects for style matching.

Test staged only:
```
tokensave_commit_context(staged_only=true)
```
Expected: Same as above but only includes staged changes (git index vs HEAD).

If no changes: returns "No changes detected."
If not a git repo: returns a git error message.

---

## tokensave_pr_context

> Summarize changes for a pull request from the current branch against main.

Test with defaults:
```
tokensave_pr_context()
```
Expected: Returns semantic diff between `main` and `HEAD`:
- Commit log (hash + subject for each commit)
- Symbols added (new symbols with no external callers)
- Symbols modified (existing symbols with external callers)
- Test files changed directly
- Affected tests (transitively impacted via dependency graph)
- Impacted modules (directories containing dependents of modified symbols)

Test with custom refs:
```
tokensave_pr_context(base_ref="develop", head_ref="feature-branch")
```
Expected: Same structure but comparing the specified refs.

---

## tokensave_simplify_scan

> Analyze changed files for quality issues.

Test:
```
tokensave_simplify_scan(files=["src/mcp/tools/handlers.rs", "src/mcp/tools/definitions.rs"])
```
Expected: Returns four categories of findings:
- **duplications**: symbols with >0.8 name similarity to symbols in other files
- **dead_introductions**: private functions/methods with no incoming edges (unreferenced)
- **complexity_warnings**: functions exceeding composite score threshold (lines + fan_out*3 > 100)
- **coupling_warnings**: files with fan_in > 15 (many dependents)

Each finding includes the symbol name, file, line number, and reason.

---

## tokensave_test_map

> Which tests cover the functions in `src/tokensave.rs`?

Test by file:
```
tokensave_test_map(file="src/tokensave.rs")
```
Expected: Returns:
- **coverage**: list of source functions/methods paired with their test callers (test name, file, line)
- **uncovered**: source functions/methods with no test callers found (up to depth 3)
- **test_files**: deduplicated list of all test files providing coverage
- **covered_symbols** / **uncovered_symbols**: counts

Test by node ID:
```
tokensave_test_map(node_id="fn:search_nodes")
```
Expected: Same structure but for a single symbol. If it's not a function/method, no coverage data is returned.

---

## tokensave_type_hierarchy

> Show the full type hierarchy for a trait. Search for the trait first, then use its node ID.

Test:
```
tokensave_type_hierarchy(node_id="trait:McpTransport")
```
Expected: Returns an indented tree showing the root type and all implementors/extenders recursively:
```
McpTransport (trait) -- src/mcp/transport.rs:191
|- implements StdioTransport (struct) -- src/mcp/transport.rs:203
|- implements ChannelTransport (struct) -- src/mcp/transport.rs:236
```

Test with depth limit:
```
tokensave_type_hierarchy(node_id="interface:Serializable", max_depth=2)
```
Expected: Same tree structure but stops at depth 2 (no grandchildren of grandchildren).

---

## tokensave_branch_search

> Search for a symbol in another branch's graph without switching your checkout.

**Prerequisites:** Multi-branch must be active. Run `tokensave branch add main` and `tokensave branch add feature-x` first.

Test:
```
tokensave_branch_search(branch="main", query="Database", limit=5)
```
Expected: Returns matching symbols from `main`'s graph, each tagged with `"branch": "main"`. Results may differ from the current branch if the symbol was modified or removed.

Test with untracked branch:
```
tokensave_branch_search(branch="nonexistent-branch", query="test")
```
Expected: Returns an error: `branch 'nonexistent-branch' is not tracked`.

---

## tokensave_branch_diff

> Compare code graphs between two branches to see what symbols were added, removed, or changed.

**Prerequisites:** Both branches must be tracked via `tokensave branch add`.

Test with defaults (current branch vs main):
```
tokensave_branch_diff()
```
Expected: Returns a JSON object with:
- `base`: the default branch name (e.g. "main")
- `head`: the current branch name
- `summary`: counts of added/removed/changed symbols
- `added`: symbols in head but not base (with name, kind, file, line, signature)
- `removed`: symbols in base but not head
- `changed`: symbols in both but with different signatures (shows both `base_signature` and `head_signature`)

Test with explicit branches:
```
tokensave_branch_diff(base="main", head="feature/foo")
```
Expected: Same structure comparing the specified branches.

Test with file filter:
```
tokensave_branch_diff(base="main", head="feature/foo", file="src/tokensave.rs")
```
Expected: Only symbols from `src/tokensave.rs` appear in the diff.

Test with kind filter:
```
tokensave_branch_diff(base="main", head="feature/foo", kind="function")
```
Expected: Only function symbols appear in the diff.

Test same branch error:
```
tokensave_branch_diff(base="main", head="main")
```
Expected: Returns an error: `base and head are the same branch: 'main'`.
